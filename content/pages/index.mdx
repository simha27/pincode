<div class="col-md-4">

#### Type on Top

Always write the type of post on the top of the letter. There are many types of posts like register post, speed post, parcel post, business post etc. You have to write this on the top of your cover of your letter or parcel as shown in the above image.

</div>

<div class="col-md-4">

#### From & To

Write both from address and to address clearly on the envelop. Writing both the from address and to address will ensure the delivery of the article. If for any reason post office is not able to deliver your article at the destination, your letter/parcel will be delivered to you if you write the from address.

</div>

<div class="col-md-4">

#### Top & Bottom

Its a good habit to write the to address on the top right hand side of the envelope. Write the from address on the bottom left hand side of the envelope either on the same side where you wrote to address or the other side.

</div>

<div class="col-md-4">

#### Write Phone Number

Post office is now sending sms alerts of the status of your article. It means you will get timely alerts of where your article currently is. So as a good habit mention the phone numbers of both the sender and the receiver on the envelop. Writing phone number will also help the delivery staff to call the customer in case the address in not clear.

</div>

<div class="col-md-4">

#### Close Properly

Always close the envelope properly so that the contents of the envelope don't fall out in the due course of transmission.

</div>

<div class="col-md-4">

#### Pincode is Compulsory

Yes, you already know about this and that's why you are here. But we will tell you once again that it's very essential to write the correct pincode to facilitate for faster transmission of your letter/parcel. Wrong pincode will probably make your letter go in the wrong direction and end up delivered very late than usual.
